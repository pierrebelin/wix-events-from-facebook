# Import Wix events from Facebook

Quick tool to import Wix events from Facebook developed in one day for local music association.

It only requires a Wix Site Id and a Wix Token to start.

For the moment, do not send more than 6 events at the same or the front will have a timeout. Add a carriage return after each event.

It can still have internal issues, but it works for me.
